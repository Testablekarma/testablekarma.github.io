          <strong>Transcriber AI: Live Notes & Summaries</strong><br />
          Effective Date: October 7, 2025
        </p>

        <p>
          Welcome to Transcriber AI. By downloading, installing, or using the
          Transcriber AI application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these
          Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these Terms,
          please do not use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing or using Transcriber AI, you acknowledge that you have
          read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy
          Policy. These Terms apply to all users of the App.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
          Transcriber AI is a mobile application that provides live
          transcription, note-taking, and AI-powered summarization services. The
          App uses speech recognition technology and artificial intelligence to
          convert spoken audio into written text and generate summaries.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Optional iCloud Sync</h2>
        <p>
          The App does not require you to create an account. However, you may
          optionally enable iCloud sync to store and sync your transcriptions
          across your Apple devices. If you choose to use iCloud sync:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your data will be stored in your personal iCloud account and is
            subject to Apple's terms and privacy policies
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Apple ID
            and iCloud account
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not have access to your iCloud data; it is managed entirely by
            Apple
          </li>
          <li>
            You can disable iCloud sync at any time through the App settings
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes. You may not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the App to record conversations without the consent of all
            parties where legally required
          </li>
          <li>
            Upload, transmit, or share content that is illegal, harmful,
            threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or otherwise
            objectionable
          </li>
          <li>
            Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the App, other accounts,
            computer systems, or networks
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the App in any manner that could disable, overburden, or impair
            its functionality
          </li>
          <li>
            Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any portion of the App
          </li>
          <li>Use automated systems to access the App without permission</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Recording and Consent</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Important:</strong> You are solely responsible for complying
          with all applicable laws regarding audio recording and consent in your
          jurisdiction. Some regions require all parties to consent to
          recording. By using Transcriber AI, you represent and warrant that you
          have obtained all necessary permissions and consents for any
          recordings you make.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <h3>6.1 Our Rights</h3>
        <p>
          The App, including its design, features, functionality, and content
          (excluding User Content), is owned by Mark Webb and is protected by

          and summarization services to you.
        </p>

        <h2>7. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
          The App offers optional monthly subscriptions and in-app purchases to
          unlock premium features. By purchasing a subscription, you agree to:
        </p>

            purchase
          </li>

            Automatic monthly renewal of your subscription unless you cancel
            before the renewal date
          </li>
          <li>
            Subscription management through your Apple App Store account
            settings
          </li>

            Pricing and availability may vary by region and are subject to
            change
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All payments are processed through the Apple App Store and managed by
          RevenueCat. They are subject to Apple's terms and refund policies. We
          do not have access to your payment information.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
        <p>

          Store account settings. Cancellation will take effect at the end of
          the current billing period. Refunds are handled according to Apple's
          refund policy. We do not offer refunds outside of Apple's policy.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          While we strive for high accuracy, transcription and AI-generated
          summaries may contain errors. The App:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Is provided "as is" without warranties of accuracy or completeness
          </li>
          <li>

            quality levels
          </li>
          <li>
            Should not be relied upon for critical, medical, legal, or
            safety-related purposes without verification
          </li>
          <li>
            Requires an internet connection for certain features and may not
            function properly without connectivity
          </li>
        </ul>
